## Python-homework

### For this assignment our goal is to create a python script for analyzing financial records using data from the csv file provided. The aim of the assignment is to calculate the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


### Technologies

* For this assignment we will be using python, pandas, and Pathlib libraries. Using the knowledge covered in class, our goal is to calculate all the figures mentioned, assign them their variables and index them by the 'Date' Column. Once completed, we can then calculate the max profit and max loss times and assign those to variables and print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
